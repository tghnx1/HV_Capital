Got it â€” hereâ€™s a **clear, professional README** for your workflow using **NewsAPI** to pull AI startup news and send it to Slack (or similar), instead of using Crunchbase.

# ðŸ“° AI Startup News Automation

## Overview

This workflow automatically retrieves the **latest news headlines** related to AI startups from **NewsAPI** and sends them to a Slack channel on a daily schedule.

It is designed as a lightweight, cost-effective alternative to Crunchbase for news monitoring â€” optimized for speed, real-time relevance, and ease of integration.

## Why NewsAPI?

While **Crunchbase** offers excellent company and funding data, it requires a paid subscription and focuses on structured business profiles rather than real-time news.
**NewsAPI** was chosen because it:

* âœ… Provides a **free tier** for development and testing
* âœ… Delivers **fresh, real-time news** from thousands of sources worldwide
* âœ… Has a **simple REST API** and quick integration
* âœ… Supports **keyword-based search** (e.g., "AI startups") and multiple languages
* âœ… Allows rapid implementation for time-sensitive automation

---

## Features

* Pulls **latest AI startup news** daily
* Filters results by:

  * Keyword (`"AI startup"`, `"artificial intelligence"`)
  * Language (e.g., English)
  * Date range (last 24 hours)
* Sends formatted headlines with source and URL to a Slack channel
* Lightweight and runs on any server or automation platform

---
